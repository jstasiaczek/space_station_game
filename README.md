# Space Station Game

A prototype of a space station management game, where you play as the station's onboard AI.

This project started as a big idea and quickly became a playground for systems, UI logic, and a bit of overengineering.

⚠️ WIP — there's not much to do here yet, but the architecture was fun to build.
